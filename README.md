- PortScan : Mimir is capable of detecting open and accessible ports on a system and provides information about them. You can use this feature to assess the security of your system and identify potential vulnerabilities.
-  Whois Lookup : With Mimir, you can perform a Whois lookup on a domain and retrieve details such as ownership, expiration date, DNS services, and other relevant information.
-  Domain Name Lookup : Need to search for a specific domain name? With this capability, Mimir allows you to search for a domain name and retrieve important information like its IP address.

With this feature, you can prioritize specific targets that may be of higher importance to you, allowing you to concentrate your time and effort on them.
